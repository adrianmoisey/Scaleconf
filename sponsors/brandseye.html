    text: Founded in 2008, BrandsEye is one of the fastest-growing online monitoring software providers. Tracking the web for relevant conversation, we use a broad spectrum of interesting technologies to provide accurate insights for our clients' business decision-making. Our system processes millions of online conversations in real-time using Java and Grails applications, working with RabbitMQ, Redis, MongoDB, MySQL and Postgresql. We analyze these conversations through machine learning algorithms and our BrandsEye Crowd. Our JavaScript application provides all the tools for our end-users to work with the data in ways which suit their needs. All of these various elements are held together with interesting DevOps coding done with Chef. One thing you won't be at BrandsEye is pigeonholed.
