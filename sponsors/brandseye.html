    text: In 2004, the BrandsEye team had a burning desire to know what consumers were saying about our clients. It drove us to start manually searching the search engines (which was painful). We then turned to the various free services available without much luck. With a knowledge of how the Internet works, a clear view of what we needed from a monitoring solution and the development skills to make it happen, we embarked on a mission to build a solution which scratched our itch. After two years of early morning and late night development our creation was born.

    text: In 2006, the first client who was using BrandsEye started paying for the service. At this stage the Online Reputation Management industry was virtually non-existent. After a further two years of development, BrandsEye moved out of Beta and on 11 March 2008, we launched it to the world to a flurry of activity. It's been an evolving adventure ever since and our software is now used in over 26 countries around the world by some of the largest global players.
  - heading: The BrandsEye philosophy
    text: The BrandsEye team believe that brands and consumers should be given as much exposure to each other as possible. Communicating via a press release no longer cuts the mustard. With heightened Internet penetration and the remarkable uptake of Social Media, there is a massive opportunity for brands to learn from consumers and for consumers to make informed purchasing decisions. The power is now in the hands of the consumer and the only way for brands to flourish is to communicate and deliver on their consumers' expectations. We understand this and aim to help brands make the most of this new world.
  - heading: Our promise
    text: We try our best to not only talk the talk but walk it too. It's no easy feat. The team's committed to pushing the boundaries of what is thought to be possible. We are passionate about adapting to an ever-changing environment and hope to strengthen our response and drive ourselves in order to better deal with the online evolution. Honesty guides our service. Transparency is guaranteed - regardless of how much this may hurt our egos. By being upfront about our strengths and weaknesses, we're able to deliver on promises. Always aware that we're nothing without the people and brands we serve, we rely on them to help us improve our software and our service as a whole. We welcome feedback - any and all of it!
