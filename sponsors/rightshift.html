    text: RightShift began life in 2005 as software developer for GoBLAM.com, a multiplayer tournament site for popular first person shooter (FPS) games. Many hours of coffee, pizza and Half-Life 2; Deathmatch later and we had built the world’s first (and still only) free- and pay-to-play FPS site to offer tournaments that could be played in a couple of hours or less yet have thousands of concurrent players take part. We still think that we were ahead of our time on that one, so the code’s gathering dust in a cupboard somewhere. Maybe one day …

    text: Meantime, in late 2007 we decided to mess about with games on Facebook since it seemed like a cool thing to do and we had some time on our hands. Several apps later, some of them moderate successes and others not so much, Clickfun Casino was born. Attracting hundreds of thousands of users per month, Clickfun has grown into an incredibly active and loyal social gaming community, with the app now also available on several mobile platforms, including iOS and Android.
