        <p>
            With such a strong technically focused conference, we have decided
            to run some free workshops, after the conference. 
            The workshops are informal hackathon-style workshops
            where the engineers from various companies will be on hand to
            walk you through getting started on their products.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are still busy planning the details of the workshops, and so
            <b>the information on this page is subject to change</b>. If you are
            interested in attending a workshop, please also add a (free)
            ticket <a href='/purchase'>workshop ticket</a> for any of the
            workshops that you want to attend.
