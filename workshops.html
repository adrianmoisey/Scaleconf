        <p>
            With such a strong technical focus for the conference, we have
            decided to run workshops before the conference to give attendees
            hands-on experience with a number of toolchains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the workshops are free first-come-first-served
            hackathon-style workshops, where the engineers from various
            companies will be on hand to walk you through getting started on
            their products.  Others are paid-for tutorials which will give you
            hands-on experience from experts in a specific topic.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Details for these workshops may change.</b> If you are interested
            in attending workshops, please indicate on the signup form so that
            we can keep you updated as workshop plans get formalised.
