        <p>
            With such a strong technical focus for the conference, we have decided
            to run workshops before the conference to give attendees hands on experience
            with the latest tools that are being used today.
        </p>
        <p>
            There will be workshops for everybody, broken down into multiple tracks
            with just a morning and afternoon session. The workshops will have limited
            capacity, so be sure to book the session you are interested in early.
