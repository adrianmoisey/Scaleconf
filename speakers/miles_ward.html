    Little teams with big results: NASA/JPL and Obama for America via AWS
abstract: >
    In 2012 two small teams set about delivering on massive expectations, on "failure-is-not-an-option" projects, with extraordinarily limited time and resources. Both teams nailed it: every space geek in the world saw the Mars Curiosity Rover's first images live from Amazon S3 and Cloudfront and watched an HD live-stream of the event, and the 170+ custom applications on AWS powering the radical Obama for America campaign played no small part in helping President Obama win his bid for re-election.  Miles Ward, your presenter, worked embedded with these teams during the design, development, testing, deployment and operational phases of these projects, and can relay a few critical insights about the use of cloud at this scale.  100,000 WCU DynamoDB tables; replicating 27TB across the continent; 60+ terabit/s of live-streamed video; over a Billion dollars in processed donations; hundreds of instances, 528,000 IOPS, oh my!
