bio: >
    is the CTO at Cognician, a local tech startup working on
    improving people's thinking. Now, going into its fourth year with a brand
    new, completely re-imagined technology stack, Cognician is providing value
    as a digital platform for self-coaching, performance support and much, much
    more.</p>
    <p>Robert has been coding for 15 years and is still not dead. Having worked in
    all facets of web development for a wide variety of use cases and people,
    he is happily astonished at how much fun he's still having, thanks in no
    small part to the Clojure language and its philosophy and community.
title: Cognician's new architecture with Clojure and Datomic
abstract:
    Robert will tour through Cognician's new architecture and ops
    infrastructure, which leverages the many advantages of Clojure - such as
    functional programming, immutable data and deep Java interop - and Datomic,
    a new database engine from the creator of Clojure, which solves many of the
    common data handling concerns when scaling web applications, so that
    scaling is far more simple to reason about and accomplish.
