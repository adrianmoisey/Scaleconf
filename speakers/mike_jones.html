bio: >
    works at Western Cape Labs, which he helped form in 2012. He calls himself a
    "Jack of all trades, master of some", which really just means he has to make his
    own coffee (and likes to shout "MARKETING" randomly at conferences). Born an
    raised in London but now resident in Cape Town with his growing family he
    appreciates all that the city has to offer as an awesome place to build a socially
    valuable business.

    It's never been easy to turn your ideas in a real scalable business but these days with the rise of the tech incubator it seems like its something that everyone is meant to be doing. This talk hopes to provide some insight based on real-world experience from someone who has tried and failed a number of times and in 2012 decided to try again right here in Cape Town. Inspired by last years ScaleConf we'll here how On The Way (a service run by Western Cape Labs) went from idea through to a something you'd hopefully happily send your mum to in 6 months.
