bio: >
    works at Western Cape Labs, which he helped form in 2012. He calls himself
    a "jack of all trades, master of some", which really just means he has to
    make his own coffee (and likes to shout "MARKETING" randomly at
    conferences). Born and raised in London, but now resident in Cape Town with
    his growing family, he appreciates all that the city has to offer as an
    awesome place to build a socially valuable business.

    It has never been easy to turn your ideas into a real scalable business, but
    these days, with the rise of the tech incubator, it seems like it's
    something that everyone is meant to be doing. This talk hopes to provide
    some insight based on real-world experience from someone who has tried and
    failed a number of times, and in 2012 decided to try again right here in
    Cape Town.  Inspired by last year's ScaleConf, we'll hear how On The Way (a
    service run by Western Cape Labs) went in six months from an idea to a
    thing you'd hopefully happily send your mum to.
