bio: >
    is Lead Engineer at BrandsEye, the online brand monitoring
    and analysis software. BrandsEye processes large volumes (3 million+) of
    tweets and other brand mentions every day, contextualising and annotating
    them with sentiment, credibility and so forth.
abstract: >
    The BrandsEye team have spent the last year or so transitioning from a
    single monolithic application with serious performance issues into a
    loosely coupled collection of applications able to handle very much
    higher volumes at far greater reliability. The new system uses a lot of
    interesting technology (RabbitMQ, Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, Postgresql,
    Grails, Java etc.) to solve various real-world problems. In this talk
    David goes into detail on the challenges and learnings encountered
    along the way.
